            <h2 id="what-is-this-blog-for">What is this blog for?</h2>
<p>I will write about nothing but hardware and logical approaches to software in regards to hardware.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>Growing up I always waited for the next game to come out and I was just amazed at what people could do with some hardware and some software. I saw also some ways where people could be helped in regards to medical devices, self care and tools to help keep them safe.
The sky wasn't the limit and as a programmer you could do anything. I played a lot of games and became interested in programming when I wanted to make my own game. I have been programming ever since.</p>
<h2 id="other-languages">Other languages</h2>
<p>I will definitely want some posts to be translated once I get the translation mechanics setup. I am trying to learn Finnish so if anyone who speaks and writes better Finnish than I do, it would be greatly appreciated
if you could make a PR and let me know what is missing. I will have a release and a commit for language updates once I get this site going. If there are any other languages that you would like to contribute, just make a PR. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="on-tutorials">On Tutorials</h2>
<p>I might do some tutorials or some subtle hints to get you started but mostly it will just be about me sharing my ideas.
I will explain the best way that I can about how I approached an issue and what I used to solve it. If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see, I could make a disqus or something for that and other topics. For now I just want to keep
it simple. Again, PRs are always welcome.</p>
<h2 id="post-script">Post Script</h2>
<p>With that in mind, see you in the next post. Stay safe out there. I would also like to thank Zola for the quick setup in regards to the blog and Athul for the archie theme. You can check out
Zola and archie from the footer below.</p>
