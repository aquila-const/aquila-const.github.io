            <h2 id="what-is-this-blog-for">What is this blog for?</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to my first blog post. My name is Hunter and I am a programmer. I constantly think sometimes will there ever be a moment in where I would ever want to stop programming,without
trying to sound like a weirdo that posts false motivational side pieces on LinkedIn, and to be honest with you there has not been a single one. I think of when I will retire some day, hopefully with only small worries,
and what I will do. I can see then at that moment...for a split second...I would still not want to stop programming.</p>
<p>So with that, I created this blog post so that I can hopefully leave something for when the world is completely forced to return back to the stone age due to the Sun and future aliens or generations possibly dig up my pc(It's a Laptop so don't hate on me).
Maybe they would ask questions like what is Linux? What are these letters on here? If by some miracle they are able to boot it up, log in and browse around. hopefully they will find this project and these writings. Until then, I will write about nothing but hardware, hopes and dreams, logical
approaches to software in regards to hardware (pretty much the only actual software and yes web3 is a scam) and my ramblings.</p>
<h2 id="why-hardware-why-programming">Why hardware? Why programming?</h2>
<p>Ahh the age old questions from a recruiter or HR. Why did you become a software developer? Why programming? I actually never get those types of questions in interviews, just pretty much borderline robo-call situations.
It kind of happened by accident. I grew up in a place where I pretty much wanted to escape and have an actual adventure almost all the time. So, I turned to games. Mainly MMORPGs to start but also some others like Diablo(yes the first one)
and then to Metal Gear Solid, Call Of Duty (where the screetchers were reborn) and then to ARPGs like God Of War (one of the greatest series in the last two decades) and some Fallout (I kind of like 76, will make 
a terminal in a later post) as well as Elder Scrolls(one of the other great series, except for ESO, just too boring) and Onimusha(can you make another one Sony?).</p>
<p>In middle school I started messing around with some terrain engine then I wanted
to do some other things like animations. So I found some information on animating, read a book on 2D games in C/C++(was kind of intimidating to be fair). A lot of it was quite difficult but I later took 3D animation in High School, which
made things somewhat easier to understand. Programming was a way for me to create something without having to waste resources. I could create a file, compile, debug, compile, debug and compile ten more times and run my code and make a bat file
and completely kill my PC(yep made my first virus that went no where and just ruined my computer, made my parents laugh though). It was like art except I didn't have to go and buy pencils, drawing pad and mess with erasing things.
Programming is truly one of the many great things humans have created.</p>
<p>I also do not like it in some senses or more so I do not like what certain people are doing to programming. Growing up I always waited for the next game to come out and
I was just amazed at what people could do with some hardware and some software. I saw also some ways where people could be helped in regards to medical devices, self care and tools to help keep them safe.
The sky wasn't the limit and as a programmer you could do anything. I still feel that way.</p>
<p>I just don't like snake oil salesmen or people who exploit others for personal gain.</p>
<h2 id="any-other-languages">Any other languages?</h2>
<p>I will definitely want some posts to be translated once I get the translation mechanics setup. I am trying to learn Finnish so if anyone who speaks and writes better Finnish than I do, it would be greatly appreciated
if you could make a PR and let me know what is missing. I will have a release and a commit for language updates once I get this site going. If there are any other languages that you would like to contribute, just make a PR. Thanks!</p>
<h2 id="will-you-do-tutorials">Will you do tutorials?</h2>
<p>I might do some tutorials or some subtle hints to get you started but mostly it will just be about me sharing my ideas. I may or may not be doing hardware reviews(I might just because some people are annoying with their reviews).
I will explain the best way that I can about how I approached an issue and what I used to solve it. If you have any suggestions on what you would like to see, I could make a disqus or something for that and other topics. For now I just want to keep
it simple. Again, PRs are always welcome.</p>
<h2 id="post-script">Post Script</h2>
<p>With that in mind, see you in the next post. Stay safe out there. I would also like to thank Zola for the quick setup in regards to the blog and Athul for the archie theme. You can check out
